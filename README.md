This is a simple and responsive **Healthcare Appointment Booking Web Application** built using **React.js** and plain CSS. Users can view a list of doctors, check their availability, view individual doctor profiles, and book appointments. A “My Appointments” section is also included to track booked appointments.

##  Improvements (Given More Time)

- Add form validation for better UX (required fields, email format)
- Store appointments in localStorage or connect to a backend API
- Use TypeScript for better type safety
- Add loading and error states for fetching data
- Integrate a calendar/time picker UI for booking
- We can add a timer and alert system for user using backend
- We can also include the  doctors feedback , medication from the   doctor side.
- We can Add a doctor rating system from the patient/user side

---

##  Challenges Faced

- Ensuring **routing works properly** with dynamic doctor IDs.
- Maintaining **responsive layout** across screen sizes.
- Managing **form data and appointment state** in a clean way using hooks.
- Dynamically rendering content conditionally ,like empty appointments view.
